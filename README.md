## Tasks:

1. Retrieve bank details from an API service. When a user starts typing, detect the bank and replace the bank name with asterisks.

2. Manage the addition of the card number and bank name into a state, and display them in the slider below.

### Bonus:

- Handle the automatic movement to the next and previous input fields when the current input is filled or cleared.
- Manage the selection of a card and add the ".slider-card--active" class to the card when it is scrolled over.
- Implement scroll-snap on the card slider.
- Add TypeScript typing.
